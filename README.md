# Official Implementations of "A Policy Gradient Primal-Dual Algorithm for Constrained MDPs with Uniform PAC Guarantees" [Experiments in Section 6]

This repository is the official implementation of the UOpt-RPGPD algorithm in [A Policy Gradient Primal-Dual Algorithm for Constrained MDPs with Uniform PAC Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17780).

* You can see the implementation in [UOpt-RPGPD-ablation.ipynb](UOpt-RPGPD-ablation.ipynb).
